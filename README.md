# Pyber Analysis Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to give insight into our PyBer ride share data from the level of the different city types: urban, suburban, and rural. Based on this data we will create a visualization of the analysis using a line plot to illustrate the differences in the fare data in each of the city types.
