# Pyber Analysis Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to give insight into our PyBer ride share data from the level of the different city types: urban, suburban, and rural. Based on this data we will create a visualization of the analysis using a line plot to illustrate the differences in the fare data in each of the city types. 

# Results 
The results of our analysis of the PyBer Ride share data followed expected trends. The activity within the PyBer ride share data reflected the respective population density of the different city types. With urabn cities having the highest population density the total rides were highest in these cities, followed by suburban and then rural with the lowest population density and thus lowest total ride count. The total ride data for the cities played a key role in the other data points associated with the different city types. 

The urban cities in the dataset had the highest total number of drivers with 2,405 followed by the suburban cities with 490 drivers and the rural cities with 78 drivers. The diffrences in the number of drivers can be attributed to differences in population density with the more populated cities tending to have more active drivers. WIth more drivers active in the urban cities this led to the urban centers generating higher total fares ($39,854.38) than both the suburban cities ($19,356.33) and rural cities ($4,327.93). An example of these trends can be seen in the line graph below which represents a sample of the dataset from the months of January through April.

The data analysis revealed that there is a negative correlation between population and average fare within the three different city types. In the urban cities the average fare per ride was $24.53, while the suburban cities had an average fare of $30.97 and rural cities having an average fare of $34.62. The higher rates in the less populated areas could be due to drivers travelling longer distances during rides in the rural and suburban areas than in urban areas. Additional data and analysis would be needed to determine if this is the case. Higher average fares in the rural areas resulted in those drivers having the highest average fares per driver at $55.49 followed by sururban drivers earning an average of $39.50 and urban drivers earning an average of $16.57.

# Summary 
## Urban Cities
Based on the analysis the recommendations for the PyBer company would be to offer some form of incentive for urban drivers to increase their average fare per ride. Since urban drivers are generating the highest share of fare revenue for the company at $39,854 in total fares but have the lowest earing per ride ($16.57) it would be important to invest in ensuring these drivers feel as if they are adequately compensated. This will support PyBer with keeping these drivers on the platform as opposed to driving for competitor platforms or finding other work in the gig economy ecosystem. One way to facilitate this would be to offer incentives for drivng during peak hours to increase the average fare per ride for urban drivers. 

## Subrban & Rural Cities
The recommendation for the suburban and rural cities would be similar to that for the urban cities. In the suburban and rural cities drivers are earning a higher fare per ride but this is possibly due to drivers in these cities having trips with longer distances. Even though drivers are earning a higher rate per ride the actual amouunt earned could be lowered due to spending more on gas. Offering an incentive to drivers who complete a certain amount of rides per week to earn gas rewards would help to offset the higher gas costs the drivers in the more spread out cities are likely paying. This recommendation is important because in the suburban and rural areas since there are less drivers on the platform than in the urban cities we want to ensure there are enough drivers to meet the demand. Incentives such as this could be one way to accomplish that.
