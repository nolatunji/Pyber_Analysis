# Pyber Analysis Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to give insight into our PyBer ride share data from the level of the different city types: urban, suburban, and rural. Based on this data we will create a visualization of the analysis using a line plot to illustrate the differences in the fare data in each of the city types. 

# Results 
The results of our analysis of the PyBer Ride share data followed expected trends. The activity within the PyBer ride share data reflected the respective population density of the different city types. With urabn cities having the highest population density the total rides were highest in these cities, followed by suburban and then rural with the lowest population density and thus lowest total rides. The total ride data for the cities played a key role in the other data points associated with the different city types.
